CKEditor Less

** Description
Simple module to glue LESS and CKEditor together,
all you need to do it enable and it.

CKEditor LESS works with themes that use the LESS
module to compile their themes on the fly, which 
means it can be difficult to determine a static
directory path for adding theme CSS into CKEditor.

This is where CKEditor LESS comes in. Once you
enable the module, it will check the recently
compiled theme's CSS files and inject them into
the CKEditor WYSIWYG.

That's it, clean and simple.
